### üéØ Field Coverage

- **Total Schema Fields:** 102+

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **No AI Classification:** Photos are marked as "unassigned" - we don't have image classification modules
2. **No Environmental Data:** Environmental factors are not available from Zillow
3. **Limited Coverage:** Zillow API provides basic property information only
4. **REAPI Alternative:** REAPI may provide additional fields (needs verification)

### üìû Next Steps

If you need additional fields, we would need to:
1. Verify what REAPI actually provides
2. Build extraction modules for specific fields
3. Implement AI classification for photos
4. Add environmental data sources

**This is our honest assessment of current capabilities.**
