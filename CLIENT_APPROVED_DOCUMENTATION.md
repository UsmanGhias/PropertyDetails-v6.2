- No photo classification applied yet
- No translation fields or advanced features
- Limited field coverage compared to REAPI

```json
{
  "PropertyDetails": {
    "identification": {
      "address_full": "123 Main St, City, ST 12345",
      "property_type": "SFR",

          "url": "https://...",
          "width": 1024,
          "height": 768,
          "classification_type": "unassigned"
        }]
      }
    ]
  }

## Key Differences

| Feature | REAPI | Zillow |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Field Coverage | 85+ fields | ~15 fields |
| Property Details | Comprehensive | Basic |
| Photos | Not available | Available (unclassified) |
| Price History | Full sale history | MLS history only |
| Features | Pool, deck, fireplace, etc. | Limited |
| Translation Fields | Yes | No (AS-IS only) |
| Classification | Not applied yet | Not applied yet |

## Client Expectations

The client has approved these exact structures and expects:

1. **REAPI**: Comprehensive property data with all available fields
2. **Zillow**: AS-IS fields only, no advanced processing
3. **No AI Classification**: Photo classification not applied yet
4. **Consistent Schema**: Both use PropertyDetails v6.0 format
